django-simple-import
====================

An import tool easy enough your users could use it. django-simple-import aims to keep track of logs 
and user preferences in the database. 

Project is now stable and feature complete. Of course it's always a good idea to test before deploying.

- Set related objects by any unique field
- Simulate imports before commiting to database
- Undo (create only) imports
- Security checks if user has correct permissions (partially implemented)

## Test Drive

The app contains a sample project.

1. Git clone the repo and enter the `simple_import/sample_project` directory
1. Install the sample project requirements (preferably into a virtualenv): `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Initialize the database: `$ python manage.py syncdb`
1. Start the server: `$ python manage.py runserver`

## Install

1. pip install django-simple-import
1. Add 'simple_import' to INSTALLED APPS
1. Add simple_import to urls.py like
urlpatterns += url(r'^simple_import/', include('simple_import.urls')),
1. syncdb (you may use south)

## Optional Settings
Define allowed methods to be "imported". Example:

    class Foo(models.Model):
        ...
        def set_bar(self, value):
            self.bar = value
        simple_import_methods = ('set_bar',)
        
### settings.py
SIMPLE_IMPORT_LAZY_CHOICES: Default True. If enabled simple_import will look up choices when importing. Example:

    choices  = ['M', 'Monday']

If the spreadsheet value is "Monday" it will set the database value to "M."

## Usage

Go to /simple_import/start_import/ or use the admin interface.

The screenshots have a django-grappelli like theme. The base templates have no style and are very basic. 
See an example of customization [here](https://github.com/burke-software/django-sis/tree/master/templates/simple_import).

It is often sufficient to simply override `simple_import/templates/base.html`.  See the sample project for an 
implementation which leverages the django.contrib.admin theme.

There is also a log of import records. Check out /admin/simple_import/.

## Odd Things

Added a special set password property on auth.User to set password. This sets the password instead of just
saving a hash.

User has some required fields that...aren't really required. Hardcoded to let them pass.

### Security
I'm working on the assumption staff users are trusted. Only users with change permission 
to a field will see it as an option. I have not spent much time looking for ways users could
manipulate URLs to run unauthorized imports. Feel free to contribute changes.
All import views do require admin "is staff" permission.
